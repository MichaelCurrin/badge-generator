## Preview

This is a convenience tool to make it easy to generate markdown for badges.

It makes text for you to copy and paste.

The focus is on using external tools to host and render images, such using [shields.io](https://shields.io) for SVG badges.

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://michaelcurrin.github.io/badge-generator/">
        <img src="/docs/_media/sample.png"
            alt="Sample screenshot"
            title="Go to the site"
            width="450" >
    </a>
</div>


## Open the web app

Start creating badges for your docs.

<div align="center">

## Sample
> Examples of a few badges generated with the app and rendered here on a markdown doc

Note most of the badges at the top of this `README.md` were also generated using this app.

### Social badges

Link to your project. From another project - even paste these in an online forum or your blog.

<div align="center">

[![MichaelCurrin - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=MichaelCurrin&message=badge-generator&color=blue&logo=github)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator)
[![stars - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator?style=social)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator)
[![forks - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator?style=social)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator)

</div>

### Repo metadata

Add to the top of your `README.md` file. These are tied to your specific repo.

<div align="center">

[![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator?include_prereleases=&sort=semver)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/releases/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](#license)
[![issues - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/issues)

</div>

### Generic

Put whatever text you want in this static badge, which is independent of a repo. You can change the color, logo and destination link.

<div align="center">

[![Foo - Bar](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foo-Bar-2ea44f)](#)
![Maintained - yes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained-yes-green)
![Contributions - welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributions-welcome-blueviolet)

</div>

### Packages

An NPM package badge that changes magically when your `package.json` file is updated.

<div align="center">

[![Package - vue](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/MichaelCurrin/badge-generator/vue?logo=vue.js&logoColor=white)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue)

</div>

### Catalogue

Pre-made badges around languages and tools. Just copy and paste. If you can't find a badge you're looking for, use the Generic badge option to make your own.
