This project started initially as an original idea using Mustache and jQuery for the templating. Though that proved to be tedious to make changes and scale to many pages.

Later on it was revised to be a Single-Page Application using [Vue](#vue).

## Generators

### GitHub Badge Generator

It is similar in terms of input and output, but built is on React.

- https://badges.amercier.com
- [amercier/badge-generator](https://github.com/amercier/badge-generator#github-badge-generator) repo.

Also it uses checkboxes around a repo, while my project generates most badges for you and you can pick what you want to use.

It also offers choices of badge styles and a choice for output (Markdown, etc.) which isn't so useful for me to add.

### GitHub Profile Readme Generator

The design and structure as partly influenced by this project.

In particular the use of `vue-markdown`, splitting the layout vertically and use of tabs.

Powered by _shields.io_ as well but using React. This focus on generic badge with any custom text, rather than multiple badges.
