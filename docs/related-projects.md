This project started initially as an original idea, using Mustache and jQuery for the templating.

Later on it was revised to be a Single-Page Application, based on Vue projects below.


## GitHub Badge Generator

It is similar in terms of input and output, but built is on React.

- https://badges.amercier.com
- [amercier/badge-generator](https://github.com/amercier/badge-generator#github-badge-generator) repo.

Also it uses checkboxes around a repo, while my project generates most badges for you and you can pick what you want to use.

It also offers choices of badge styles and a choice for output (Markdown, etc.) which isn't so useful for me to add.


## GitHub Profile Readme Generator

The design and structure as partly influenced by this project.

In particular the use of `vue-markdown`, splitting the layout vertically and use of tabs.
